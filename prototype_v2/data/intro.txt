Welcome to the MarineGEO Chemical and Physical Observation Program's Annotation Portal. This application allows MarineGEO sites to submit Korexo data and begin quality control workflows immediately. Once submitted, data undergoes an initial algorithmic scan that assigns level 1 quality control flags. Data providers then must evaluate the level 1 flags and provide additional codes to assist further quality control. The quality control workflow is conducted using an intuitive visualization interface. Quality control progress can be saved and restarted at a later date.
